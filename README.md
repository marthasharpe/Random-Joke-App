# Random Quote Machine

### A freeCodeCamp project.

I build this page using React and intended to use it as a re-make of my Stan Lee Tribute page.  
Unfortunately, it wouldn't pass the freeCodeCamp test unless each quote was from a different author.  
I got around this by changing Stan's first name for each quote.

I later made a different repo for a Stan Lee React Tribute which you can see [here](https://stan-lee-tribute.netlify.com/).
